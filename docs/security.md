# Security and abuse protection

The app is public and anonymous, and runs on free API quotas. The main risk is not data theft but
**someone using up the shared AI and search quotas** so the app stops working for everyone. These are
the layers that prevent that, and what to set up before releasing it.

## What protects the quotas

| Layer | What it does | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Bot check | Cloudflare Turnstile token required for every setup step (**resume upload**, **Analyse**, the **match**, **research**), **Start interview**, **Practise again** and restoring with a recovery code. Single-use, verified server-side, fails closed. | `server/src/http/botcheck.ts`, `client/src/api/botCheck.ts` |
| Per-person daily budget | AI tokens: 150,000 per candidate, 300,000 per IP, as reported by the provider (estimated at four characters a token when it doesn't report usage). Interviews: 5 per candidate, 5 per IP. Uncached web searches: 9 per IP. An IPv6 client's whole /64 counts as one IP, since one client usually controls all of it. | `server/src/usage/meter.ts` |
| Burst limit | 20 AI calls per minute, per candidate and per IP; 10 passkey or sign-in attempts per minute per IP. | same |
| Per-model daily caps | Models with a token quota of their own (Groq: 200,000 a day each) are capped a little under it in `server/src/ai/models.ts`; once one is used up, it is refused with a "switch models" message instead of failing at the provider. | `server/src/ai/models.ts`, `server/src/usage/meter.ts` |
| Global daily caps | 1,500,000 AI tokens and 30 uncached web searches a day across everyone, under the providers' and Tavily's free quotas. Users see "out of free capacity for today" instead of random failures. | same |
| Charged per AI call | Every AI call checks the budget right before it's made and records its tokens when it finishes; re-showing a saved question costs nothing. | `server/src/interview/service.ts` |
| Hard caps per interview | At most 12 questions, 2 retries and 5 coach messages per question; answer and message length limits. | `server/src/interview/schemas.ts` |
| Shared research cache | Briefings are cached 7 days per company + role + seniority, for everyone. | `server/src/research/briefing.ts` |
| Maintenance switch | `MAINTENANCE_MODE=true` pauses new work without a deploy; interviews in progress finish. | `server/src/http/security.ts` |

All budgets are environment variables (see `server/.env.example`).

## Other protections

- **Secrets stay on the server.** AI, search and database keys are only read by the API; the browser
  only ever sees the public Turnstile site key. No secret has ever been committed (history checked).
- **Client IP can't be spoofed.** In production it comes from `CLIENT_IP_HEADER` (`X-Real-IP`, which the
  host's Nginx overwrites), and the containers listen on localhost only. Without it (local dev)
  client-supplied forwarding headers are ignored.
- **No CORS.** The site and API share one origin, so other websites can't call the API from a browser.
- **Security headers.** A strict Content Security Policy (own scripts plus Cloudflare's challenge only),
  HSTS, no framing, `nosniff` (`deploy/web.conf`); the API adds `no-store` and hides the framework.
- **Input validation.** Every request body is validated (zod), ids are format-checked, PDFs are capped
  at 4 MB and 20 pages and discarded after text extraction.
- **Prompt injection.** Web pages are fenced as untrusted data, links in briefings only come from search
  results, and the AI has no tools. A candidate can only steer the AI within their own interview; the
  coach declines unrelated requests.
- **Data isolation.** Every interview is scoped to its browser's random candidate id (a 122-bit UUID),
  issued by the server as an `HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict` cookie on `/api` (`Secure` in production), so page
  scripts can't read it.
- **Saved history.** Passkeys are verified with WebAuthn (single-use challenges, 5-minute expiry, bound to
  the production domain, `PUBLIC_ORIGIN`, never the request's Host), up to
  10 per history. Recovery codes have 100 random bits, are stored only as a SHA-256 hash, and restoring
  with one needs the bot check (`server/src/account/`). Browsers from before the cookie can carry their id
  over in a header, but only while that history isn't saved: a saved one needs its passkey or code.
- **Stored links.** Briefing source links must be http(s), including in setups sent from the browser.
- **Dependencies.** `pnpm audit` reports no known vulnerabilities.

## Watching usage

`/admin` shows today's (or yesterday's) usage: what's left of the global and per-model caps, and the
heaviest candidates and networks. It needs `ADMIN_TOKEN` (32+ random characters; the page and its API are
off without it), sent as a bearer token and compared in constant time; any refusal is a plain 404. The
token is kept only in that browser tab. Days are UTC, and counters are kept two days.

## Known limits

- **Anonymous by design.** Someone determined, with many IPs and solved bot checks, can still use up
  the daily global caps. They can't exceed them, so the cost is bounded at zero, but the app would be
  unavailable for the rest of that day. If that happens, the next step is requiring sign-in.
- **Interviews are kept indefinitely**, including resume text. Candidates can delete their own.
- **The browser id is the key** to a candidate's interviews: until they save their history, clearing
  site data loses access. Anyone with access to the browser, or to a candidate's passkey or recovery
  code, can see them. An id never changes: signing out or replacing the recovery code doesn't revoke a
  copied cookie.
- **Passkeys only work on the production domain** (`SITE_ADDRESS`); changing it strands them, though recovery codes still work.
- **Restoring on a shared computer** also moves in that browser's unsaved interviews, which may be a
  previous person's.

## Release checklist

1. **Turnstile:** create a widget in the Cloudflare dashboard for your production domain. Set
   `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` as a secret in the GitHub `production` environment and `VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY`
   as a repository variable.
2. **MongoDB Atlas:**
   - Create a database user with **readWrite on this database only**, and a long random password.
   - Network access: allow only the server's public IP (reserve it so it never changes); never reuse
     this user elsewhere.
3. **Server:** set every server variable from `server/.env.example` in the GitHub `production` environment
   (keys as secrets); each deploy writes them to `server/.env`, readable only by its owner. Keep ports
   8080 and 8081 off the public internet: only the host's Nginx may reach the containers.
4. **Provider keys:** use keys created only for this app, so they can be revoked without breaking
   anything else. Leave optional providers unset if you don't want them offered.
5. **Budgets:** check each provider's current free quota and set `DAILY_TOKENS` and `DAILY_SEARCHES`
   comfortably below them.
6. **After launch:** watch `/admin` (set `ADMIN_TOKEN` first) and `docker compose logs` for unusual use.
   If needed, lower the budgets or set `MAINTENANCE_MODE=true` in the `production` environment (both take
   effect on the next deploy; run the workflow by hand).
